# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Final Project -- Restaurant Reviews App

## Objective

Incrementally convert a static webpage into a mobile application. The areas of focus were responsive design, accessibility and offline use. There were also defects to correct. 

We were allowed to use external JavaScript libraries. But were not allowed to use UI frameworks. 

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). 


### Running the project 

To run and test the project, clone or download the repo.  If you have Python installed you can start a simple http server. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

Open a terminal window in the project root. Confirm which version of Python is installed using `python -V`.  

If using Python 2, start the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.  Or a different port if 8000 is in use. 

If using Python 3, start the server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`. Or a different port if 8000 is in use. 

Once the server is running open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view and test the app. 

Note that this must be viewed as locahost because of the service worker and CORS policies. Unless you run it on a server with https.
